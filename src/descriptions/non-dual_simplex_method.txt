You can solve a simple Non-Dual-Simplex-Method-Requiring PL problems
with non-negative variables simply by inserting a Matrix containing
Constraints Coefficients, and let the last raw contains the
Functions Coefficients indeed, followed/// by an unique 0 element
to align Matrix Dimension. Successively you have to inform the program about the
Constraints Types, simply by inserting a n-dimensional Vector
(following Program Instructions is relatively simple), whose i'th element has to be 0
if the i'th constraint is in the type of '<=' condition.
It has to be an integer different from 0 otherwise.
